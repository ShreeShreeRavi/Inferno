# Infernoo System

To prevent fire accidents and minimize economic loss, Infernoo system provides fire pre-plans for various industries.

## Features

* Infernoo utilizes a Geographic Information System (GIS) Display in the Fire Station to highlight high-risk fire areas and provides a detailed industry-wide map in the Industry Control Room
* The display in the control room is equipped with three types of alerts (High, Medium, and Low) that activate within 3 seconds of fire detection, depending on the cause and intensity of the fire
* In the event of a gas leak detection, alerts are sent to both the Industry Administrator and the employees
* Sensors and cameras are employed to detect the cause and intensity of a fire
* The system includes ducts and valve systems for deploying extinguishers or water, depending on the cause of the fire
* The system employs programmable LED strips on the floor that light up during a fire, guiding people along the safest evacuation paths, particularly in moments of panic
* Emergency exit door is opened by motoring operation when the fire is detected

## GIS Integration

* Infernoo utilizes GIS to identify high-risk areas within the refinery, like places with flammable materials or possible sources of ignition
* These displays provide real-time information about the refinery's layout, highlighting vulnerable areas and potential hazards

## Mobile Application

* A mobile application is provided to each and every industry employee for easy notification in case of a fire

## Fire Suppression System

* Infernoo includes a network of ducts and valves that can dispatch extinguishing agents or water to suppress fire swiftly
* A well-defined fire pre-plan is in place for evacuation
* Programmable LED strips are provided with a separate battery source to prevent fire hazards
* Supplemental resources can be employed to ensure a fire is fully extinguished if an extinguisher's capacity is exceeded
* Consistent upkeep and checks are essential to guarantee that fire extinguishers are in optimal working condition

## Technology Stack

* Sensor (Smoke, gas, temperature, flame) - Hazard Detection
* Microcontroller - For notification & Control
* Navigating LED - Guidance for pathway during evacuation process
* GIS heat map - Spatial Data Visualization
* Flutter - UI Development
* Machine learning implemented camera - Detection of fire
